# Reverse an Array
Create a function to reverse an array.

## Challenge
The challenge to to create a function that reverses a given array, without using any built-in array methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to use a brute force approach to take a new, empty array, then loop through the given array, and finally copy the iterated array into the new array in reverse order. I did some looking at recurison and think that may be a more efficient approach, but I haven't quite worked out how to solve using recursion.
