# First-in, First out Animal Shelter.
## Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a _first-in_, _first-out_ approach.
Implement the following methods:
* `enqueue(animal)`: adds `animal` to the shelter. `animal` can be either a dog or a cat object.
* `dequeue(pref)`: returns either a dog or a cat. If `pref` is not `"dog"` or `"cat"` then return null.
